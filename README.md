# Escape-Room-Game
This is an escape room game based on a number-guessing mechanic. Players are trapped in a room and must unlock three number locks to escape. Each lock has a secret number between 1 and 20, and the player has 5 attempts to guess each number. After each guess, the game provides feedback, indicating whether the guess is "too high" or "too low," until the player guesses correctly. If the player fails to guess the correct number within the given attempts, the game ends with a failure message. Once all locks are unlocked, the player successfully escapes the room and wins.
# Features
· Three number locks, with 5 attempts per lock.

· Each lock has a randomly generated secret number, and players guess the correct number using hints.

· Basic input validation and error handling mechanisms.

# Escape-Room-Game
This is an escape room game based on a number-guessing mechanic. Players are trapped in a room and must unlock three number locks to escape. If the player fails to guess the correct number within the given attempts, the game ends with a failure message. Once all locks are unlocked, the player successfully escapes the room and wins.
